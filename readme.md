#Ho-My-Timer
##Let me to know how time since a date

This project was initiated for the website [www.laquadrature.net](http://www.laquadrature.net) and it will just display a counter in page with a video background for a smile because the subjects who are waited, are not funny in reality

###Install
To install the project, just copy it and do a `bower install` in root, bower is the truth ;)

For built this interface, we used :
- materialize for a cute design
- moment to manipulate date
- vide for background video
- jquery because we need to manipulate the dom
- jQuery-Flex-Vertical-Center for center the content vertically
- [mazwai.com](http://mazwai.com/) for the free webM video footage located in the video folder

###Fork me
You can reuse, inspirate or rebuild all this project. To be more fun, all is configurable on the `js/ho-my-timer.js` file.
You will find a config block under L7 and L16, with all site configuration.
